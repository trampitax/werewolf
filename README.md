Thanks to Ariahhl1 for the persian translation!

## What is this?
Just the simple version of the game now available on Discord. It's based on the game "The werewolves of millers hollow", a board game for eight or more players.


## Why you developed this?
I'm studying web developing at the moment, but during my summer vacations I thought that it would be really nice to practice a bit before start studying again. The game is quite simple right now, I encourage you to check the code if you are feeling curious.

It took me a whole afternoon to develop the "skeleton" of the game and I continue improving and fixing it day after day. I have to admit  that it's really pleasant to feel how your game is avancing step to step because of your efforts!

## Are you going to continue developing the game?
For the moment I'm not going to continue with the development of the game. I'll be very busy now and I'm pretty shure I won't have enough time right now and also have other projects in mind. However I don't discard the option of adding more roles in the future!

## I'd like to help you translating the game to other languages, what could I do?
Just ask me! I'll be really glad to accept your help and it also would let more people to use the bot. If you use !ww info you could get my Discord ID, write me there!
